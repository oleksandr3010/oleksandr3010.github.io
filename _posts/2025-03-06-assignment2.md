# Guiding questions for this assignment
- What kind of source is it?
- What kinds of data does that source provide?
- Was the data directly or indirectly communicated? In other words, did you have to assume anything to create new columns?
- How did you create a prompt for GPT or Gemini to automate the extraction of the information?
- How good was the automation? What did you have to change?
- When you mapped the data, did you see any interesting patterns? Were there areas of concentration of points? Did mapping the additional columns (profession, gender, etc) lead to any visible clusters?
- If you were to do this over many more pages then you did for this assignment, what kind of results do you think the different scale would give?
- If you were to do this assignment with a source not included here, what would your ideal source be?
